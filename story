once opon a time when a corcodile was sleeping, a little brown monkey desided to ran on the corcodile. As the corcodiles first instict he graded the monkey and almost ate it ,but within 2 second he recacnived the monkey. It was his nabor. So him being generous let him go and went on with his day. 
Although he missed part of his nap he got to do somthing good for his nabor.
